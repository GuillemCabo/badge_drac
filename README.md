Current schematic has some issues discovered after the first run.
If you are interested to make your own let me know and I will give more priority.

PCB art and FP are fine.

Badges gifted at ORConf 2019 have limited functionality. Only capacitive touch sensors,
buzzer, RGB leds and push buttons were tested.

Code ideas:
Two player reaction time game with touch buttons and LEDs
Closet alarm with ambient light sensor and buzzer.
Coordination minigame, you have to push righ left in function of led color, maybe put some music in the buzzer as well...
